This program sets up a nail appointment printing a receipt at the end displaying appointment details including the total. 
It uses a combination of appropriate data types, a switch statement, multiple controlled statements, operators, multiple 
classes, objects and methods, 2 arrays, inheritance, imports packages, and implements interfaces. 

This program begins with welcoming the customer, it then prints out the option menu, with a total of 6 options and 2 
add-ons. It prompts the user to select an option, once the user inputs a valid option the program will then ask if 
they would like another service. After the user enters all the options they want the program will then ask if they 
would like an add-on. Depending on the customer's choice it will either display the available add-ons and get their 
input or move on to the next thing. In the next section the user will enter their name and select a date and time 
from the available options. Once all the information is filled out a receipt will print out displaying all the 
appointment details including the total, it will also display where the recipt.txt file is located.
